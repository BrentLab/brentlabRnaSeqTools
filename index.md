# Introduction

This is a collection of objects and functions intended to make interacting 
with the brentlab rnaseq database simpler. There are two target audiences: 
wet lab folks who are not primarily computational analysts, and computational 
analysts. There is some functionality in this collection of objects and functions 
which overlap the two groups of users, and some that do not. For the functionality 
which is intended for the computational analysts, a high level of computational 
fluency is assumed.

Every function, object and data loaded by the package is documented. 
Use `?functionName` to view the documentation.

use this package, set up your environment, and also how to pull data from the 
archive rather than directly from the database.

## Reference
All of the functions in the package, organized by purpose

## Articles
This is a collection of vignettes -- see the list for instructions on, for example,
running the raw read (fastq) processing pipeline.
